# USB Monitoring and Email Alert System

This project provides scripts to monitor USB device insertions and removals on Windows and Linux systems. When a USB device is connected or disconnected, an alert is displayed, and an email notification is sent automatically.

---

## Features

- Monitors USB device events on Windows and Linux.
- Sends email alerts for insertions and removals.
- Securely manages email credentials via environment variables.
- Easy to set up and extend.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `pyudev` (Linux)
  - `pywin32` (Windows)
- Email account with SMTP access (Gmail recommended)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or download this repository

### 2. Install required Python packages

For Linux:

```bash
pip install pyudev
```

For Windows:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

### 3. Configure Email Credentials

Set your email credentials as environment variables for security:

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export SENDER_EMAIL='your_email@gmail.com'
export SENDER_PASSWORD='your_app_password'
export RECIPIENT_EMAIL='recipient_email@gmail.com'
```

**On Windows Command Prompt:**

```cmd
set SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
set SENDER_PASSWORD=your_app_password
set RECIPIENT_EMAIL=recipient_email@gmail.com
```

*Note:*  
- Use an **App Password** if your email provider requires it (e.g., Gmail with 2FA).
- Never hard-code credentials in scripts.

### 4. Run the scripts

- **Windows:**

```bash
python usb_monitor_win.py
```

- **Linux:**

```bash
python usb_monitor_linux.py
```

The scripts will run indefinitely, monitoring USB events until you terminate with `Ctrl+C`.
